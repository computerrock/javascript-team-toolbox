# Project setup guide

!Work in progress!

Main technology stack we use in team is: React, Redux, Sass/SCSS, built and transpilled with Webpack and Babel. We also 
use application level libraries: redux-saga, redux-thunk, moment.js, Immutable.js

Older projects may use more legacy stack based on: React, Flux, built and transpilled with Gulp, Browserify and Babel.
