### Projects and starter packs

If you need to setup new project, or just want to learn how project is bootstrapped check 
[`Project setup`](./project-setup.md) document. 

In [`./packages`](./packages) folder you can find starter packs that you can use to jump start new project with some 
specific setup:

* [`starter-react-app-base`](./packages/starter-react-app-base)
* [`starter-react-app-src-redux-saga`](./packages/starter-react-app-src-redux-saga)

Always refer to `README.md` project files for additional instructions on how to use them.


### Packages

For all projects we use and centrally maintain basic packages needed (presets, configs, tools, reusable components). 
This saves us time configuring, maintaining and keeping them up to date on individual projects. Packages available: 

* [`@computerrock/babel-preset-react-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@computerrock/babel-preset-react-app)
* [`@computerrock/babel-preset-react-lib`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@computerrock/babel-preset-react-lib)
* [`@computerrock/react-dev-utils`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@computerrock/react-dev-utils)
* [`@computerrock/eslint-config-base`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@computerrock/eslint-config-base)
* [`@computerrock/eslint-config-react-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@computerrock/eslint-config-react-app)
* [`@computerrock/eslint-config-react-native-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@computerrock/eslint-config-react-native-app)
* [`@computerrock/stylelint-config-react-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@computerrock/stylelint-config-react-app)

You can find sourcecode for them in [`./packages`](./packages) folder and use them via `npm install`.
