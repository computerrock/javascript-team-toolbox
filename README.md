# JavaScript Technology Team Toolbox

In this project you will find all necessary information, guides, tools, and packages you need when working on projects.


### Guides

Start by reading [`JavaScript Technology Team Guide`](./javascript-technology-team-guide.md), then also check:

* [`Development Environment Setup Guide`](./environment-setup-guide.md)
* [`JavaScript Style Guide`](./javascript-style-guide.md)
* [`Sass/SCSS Style Guide`](./sass-scss-style-guide.md)
* [`Project setup and contribution guide`](./project-setup-and-contribution-guide.md)


### Starter packs

Example project starter packs? (TODO)


### Packages

For projects we use and centrally maintain basic packages needed (presets, configs, and tools). This saves us time 
configuring, maintaining and keeping them up to date on individual projects. You can find them in `./packages` folder
and use them via npm. Packages available: 

* @computerrock/babel-preset-react-app
* @computerrock/eslint-config-base
* @computerrock/eslint-config-react-app
* @computerrock/eslint-config-react-native-app
* @computerrock/stylelint-config-react-app
* @computerrock/react-dev-utils


### Other documents

In `./other-docs` folder you will find other less important but equally useful guides and files. Feel free to check them 
out on your own. Have idea about some new useful guide? Please submit it in pull request. Happy hacking!
