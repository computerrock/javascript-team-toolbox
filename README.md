### Packages

For projects we use and centrally maintain basic packages needed (presets, configs, and tools). This saves us time 
configuring, maintaining and keeping them up to date on individual projects. Packages available: 

* [@computerrock/babel-preset-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@computerrock/babel-preset-react-app)
* [@computerrock/eslint-config-base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@computerrock/eslint-config-base)
* [@computerrock/eslint-config-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@computerrock/eslint-config-react-app)
* [@computerrock/eslint-config-react-native-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@computerrock/eslint-config-react-native-app)
* [@computerrock/stylelint-config-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@computerrock/stylelint-config-react-app)
* [@computerrock/react-dev-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@computerrock/react-dev-utils)

You can find sourcecode for them in [`./packages`](./packages) folder and use them via `npm install`. For installation
and usage steps refer to [`Project setup`](./project-setup.md) document.


### Starter packs (work in progress)

project with some specific setup:
