!Work in progress!

Principles:

* Component-based UI
* Application store as a single source of truth
* Unidirectional data flow
* Declarative over imperative
* Data immutability

A software component encapsulates a set of functionality and allows that to be consumed via a clearly defined interface. 
Thus a component based architecture is one where the software application is built up from several components that 
interact via well defined interfaces. Components are created with division of responsibility, reusability principles in
 mind and may offer various interfaces to fulfill the responsibilities.
